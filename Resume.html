    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The Chicago-based medical clinic where I've worked as a physician assistant for the past three years was recently acquired by a national conglomeration of clinics. The merger was finalized January 1, 2013 and coincidentally I was in Istanbul, Turkey that day.<br>
    It was the beginning of a new year, and the beginning of a new journey for me because I decided not to become a faceless number in a mega-corp. Instead, I'm stepping away from medicine and doing some exploration. There is a very creative side of my personality that I've been squelching for years.<br>
    I'm an introvert to the core. I relax into extroversion.<br>
    I am obsessed with books, especially classic fiction. Think Dickens, Austin, and Dumas.<br>
    I've spent the past seven years working as a physician assistant. I've worked in internal medicine, pre-operative anesthesia at the University of Chicago, and sports medicine.<br>
    What I'm into these days... I'm exploring web design through Starter League's Visual Design and Beginner HTML &amp; CSS classes. Copy editing, blogging, crocheting, and making "things" with a Shape Oko are a few other recent obsessions.</p>
